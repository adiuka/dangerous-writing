# dangerous-writing

The app that allows you to try your luck at writing spontaneously. Be careful though! If you do not write for 5 seconds, you will lose everything you have.

The app is very simple, hit start to start, it will give you a minute to write, and a 5 second timer that resets on keystrokes.

Some future improvements:
1. The app is absolutelly disgusting. I would like to switch to another GUI, or use a tkinter template.
2. I would liketo add functionality that allows you to choose how long would you like your writing session to be.
3. I would also like to add more save formats.
4. The tkinter entry box does not create a new line if a word does not fit in it's entirety, which makes it look weird.
